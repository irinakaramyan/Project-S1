# Project-S1
Student project for C language

This repository houses a console-based Hospital Management System (HMS) implemented in the C programming language. The system provides fundamental functionalities for managing patient information within a hospital setting. Users can execute operations such as adding new patients, displaying patient details, searching for patients, modifying patient information, and gracefully exiting the system.

Features
Add New Patient: Input critical details for a new patient, including their name, age, gender, address, and diagnosed disease.

Display Patients: Present a comprehensive list of all registered patients along with their details in the console.

Search Patient: Allow users to search for a specific patient by name and display their information.

Modify Patient Details: Empower users to update information for a specific patient.

Exit: Provide an option for users to gracefully exit the program.

Usage Notes
The program employs a simplified approach using an array to store patient data.
For real-world applications, hospital management systems typically involve more advanced features, including database integration.
